# terraform_templates

This repository holds terraform manifests I created to make myself familier with concepts like
1. Subnetting
2. Internet Gateway
3. NAT Gateway
4. Routing tables
5. Firewall/Security groups

Since terraform is associated with Cloud Computing providers, these manifests can serve as templates for beginners in order to get started with Cloud.
